Compiling Vim from source is actually not that difficult. Here's what you should do:

First, install all the prerequisite libraries, including Git. For a Debian-like Linux distribution like Ubuntu, that would be the following:

sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libgnome2-dev libgnomeui-dev \
    libgtk2.0-dev libatk1.0-dev libbonoboui2-dev \
    libcairo2-dev libx11-dev libxpm-dev libxt-dev python-dev \
    ruby-dev git
For Fedora 20, that would be the following:

sudo yum install -y ruby ruby-devel lua lua-devel luajit \
    luajit-devel ctags git python python-devel \
    python3 python3-devel tcl-devel \
    perl perl-devel perl-ExtUtils-ParseXS \
    perl-ExtUtils-XSpp perl-ExtUtils-CBuilder \
    perl-ExtUtils-Embed
This step is needed to rectify an issue with how Fedora 20 installs XSubPP:

# symlink xsubpp (perl) from /usr/bin to the perl dir
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/xsubpp /usr/share/perl5/ExtUtils/xsubpp 
Remove vim if you have it already.

sudo apt-get remove vim vim-runtime gvim
On Ubuntu 12.04.2 you probably have to remove these packages as well:

sudo apt-get remove vim-tiny vim-common vim-gui-common
Once everything is installed, getting the source is easy. If you're not using vim 7.4, make sure to set the VIMRUNTIMEDIR variable correctly below (for instance, with vim 7.4a, use /usr/share/vim/vim74a):

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
cd vim
./configure --with-features=huge \
            --enable-multibyte \
            --enable-rubyinterp \
            --enable-pythoninterp \
            --with-python-config-dir=/usr/lib/python2.7/config \
            --enable-perlinterp \
            --enable-luainterp \
            --enable-gui=gtk2 --enable-cscope --prefix=/usr
make VIMRUNTIMEDIR=/usr/share/vim/vim74
sudo make install
